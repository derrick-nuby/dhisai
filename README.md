# DHIS2 AI Assistant

## Project Description

Welcome to the DHIS2 AI Assistant project! This is an innovative application that leverages artificial intelligence to interact with DHIS2, a widely used health management data platform. The DHIS2 AI Assistant enables users to query, analyze, and visualize health data from DHIS2 systems using natural language, making it easier for health officials, data analysts, and other stakeholders to access and interpret complex data.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Querying**: Users can ask questions in plain language, and the AI will automatically interpret the query, fetch the relevant data from DHIS2, and present the response with contextual insights.
- **Multi-Instance Integration**: The assistant can handle multiple DHIS2 instances, allowing users to compare and analyze data across different regions, projects, or timeframes.
- **Data Visualization**: The tool generates interactive visualizations like bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps, which help users easily interpret trends and patterns in health data.
- **Project-Based Organization**: Users can organize DHIS2 instances into projects, allowing for more focused data analysis and streamlined workflows.
- **Report Generation**: The AI Assistant can generate comprehensive reports, including charts, insights, and summaries, which can be downloaded in various formats like PDF or Excel.
- **Suggested Follow-up Prompts**: After a query, the assistant suggests related questions or areas of exploration, helping users dive deeper into the data.

## How It Works

1. **Connect DHIS2 Instances**: Users input the URL and API token for their DHIS2 instance(s).
2. **Ask Questions**: Users type in natural language queries (e.g., "What is the malaria incidence rate in Kigali for Q2 2025?").
3. **Data Retrieval & Analysis**: The AI fetches the relevant data, performs any necessary analytics, and presents the results.
4. **Visualizations & Reporting**: The tool generates charts and graphs based on the data, and users can download full reports.

## Technologies Used

- **AI Engine**: Powered by OpenAI's GPT models for natural language processing.
- **Backend**: Integration with DHIS2 APIs for data fetching.
- **Frontend**: User interface built with React.js (or Vue.js, depending on your implementation).
- **Data Visualization**: Using libraries like Plotly or Vega for rendering charts and graphs.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (for backend and frontend development)
- A DHIS2 instance with API access and an API token

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone ...
   cd dhis2-ai-assistant
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your DHIS2 instance URL and API token in the configuration file (`config.js` or `.env`).

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the DHIS2 AI Assistant.
